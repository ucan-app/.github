# UW Computing Alumni Network (UCAN)

A platform connecting University of Washington computing students and alumni to foster professional connections and knowledge sharing within the computing industry.

## Project Overview

UCAN aims to create a dedicated network that bridges the gap between current UW computing students and industry professionals who graduated from UW. Unlike existing alumni networks focused primarily on fundraising, UCAN is designed to facilitate meaningful career-related conversations and mentorship opportunities.

### Why UCAN?

While the Allen School maintains an alumni network, its primary focus appears to be fundraising and outreach rather than creating an online community. UCAN addresses this gap by:

- Connecting UW alumni in the computing industry with each other
- Providing current students access to professional insights not available in academic settings
- Facilitating knowledge sharing about job search, interview processes, and industry expectations
- Creating a supportive community similar to successful networks like USC's Trojan Network

## Features

- **LinkedIn Integration**: A LinkedIn group serves as the front-facing platform for the network
- **Profile System**: Optional user profiles to showcase experience and interests
- **Blog Platform**: Structured space for alumni to share career experiences and insights
- **Discussion Forum**: Q&A section for students to ask specific career-related questions
- **Newsletter/Notification System**: Keeps members informed about events and opportunities

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Mocha (with potential Cypress E2E testing)

### Backend

# ðŸ“œ User Manual

## High-Level Description:

UCAN aims to create a dedicated network that bridges the gap between current UW computing students and industry professionals who graduated from UW. Unlike existing alumni networks focused primarily on fundraising, UCAN is designed to facilitate meaningful career-related conversations and mentorship opportunities.

## How to Install Software:

- Ensure you have access to a web browser such as Chrome or FireFox

## How to Run Software:

- Navigate to the following website: [ucan.net](https://ucan.net/) (deployment is still in progress, for now the software can only be accessed locally by following the steps in the developer documents in the frontend and backend repositories)

## How to Use Software:

Please follow the below steps on how to use and navigate through our webapp.

### Creating an account:

Having an account is the best way to use our website, but browsing without one is fine as well.

- Users can create an account by navigating to the user icon at the top-right corner of the page and signing up. They must then login using their credentials to gain access to their account.
- The account making process will require email verification of the base email address used.
- Afterwards, itâ€™s recommended to add a badge that indicates if youâ€™re a UW student or Alumni and your current company name through further email verification. This adds credibility to the posts you make.

### Editing profile:

- Users are able to edit their profile once they have logged into their account.

  - Linkedin URL
  - Personal websites
  - Badges

- Users will be able to access other users profilesâ€™ by clicking on their username in the posts.

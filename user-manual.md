# ðŸ“œ User Manual

## High-Level Description:

UCAN aims to create a dedicated network that bridges the gap between current UW computing students and industry professionals who graduated from UW. Unlike existing alumni networks focused primarily on fundraising, UCAN is designed to facilitate meaningful career-related conversations and mentorship opportunities.

## How to Install Software:

- Ensure you have access to a web browser such as Chrome or FireFox

## How to Run Software:

- Navigate to the following website: [ucan.net](https://ucan.net/) (deployment is still in progress, for now the software can only be accessed locally by following the steps in the developer documents in the frontend and backend repositories)

## How to Use Software:

### Creating an account:

Having an account is the best way to use our website, but browsing without one is fine as well.

- Users can create an account by navigating to the user icon at the top-right corner of the page and signing up. They must then login using their credentials to gain access to their account.
- The account making process will require email verification of the base email address used. (work in progress)
- Afterwards, itâ€™s recommended to add a badge that indicates if youâ€™re a UW student or Alumni and your current company name through further email verification. This adds credibility to the posts you make. (implemented in backend, work in progress in frontend)

### Editing profile:

- Users are able to edit their profile once they have logged into their account.
- The default profile only stores the username which is unchangeable, but additional information can be provided and displayed on the userâ€™s profile if the user chooses to edit their profile. These include:
  A short bio
  Graduation year
  Linkedin URL
  Personal websites
  Badges (work in progress)
  First and last name (work in progress)

- Users will be able to access other users profilesâ€™ by clicking on their username in the posts. (work in progress)

### Creating and viewing posts:

- Create a post with a title and content.
- Add tags to categorize your post based on its topic. (work in progress)
- A preview of all posts can be viewed on the homepage in the form of a forum.
- Individual posts can be viewed in their entirety by clicking on them, which will display the list of comments and comment replies associated with the post.
- Users will be able to view the posts theyâ€™ve made by navigating to the user icon. (work in progress)

### Searching and interacting with posts: (work in progress)

- Like or dislike posts and comments based on how helpful they are.
- Use the search bar to find posts with certain keywords or with a certain tag.
- Add comments to posts youâ€™d wish to ask questions or engage with in any way.
